### Problem 1

#### Data description

The `early_january_weather` dataset contains 358 rows and 15 columns.

It includes hourly weather observations from New York City in early
January 2013. Key variables include:

- `time_hour`: the date-time of observation  
- `temp`: temperature in Fahrenheit  
- `humid`: relative humidity (0–100)  
- `wind_dir`: wind direction
- `wind_speed`: wind speed in mph  
- `visib`: visibility in miles  
- plus other variables describing conditions such as `pressure`and
  `origin`.

The mean temperature during this period was 39.6 °F.

#### Creating a scatterplot

``` r
library(ggplot2)

p <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "plasma") +
  labs(title = "NYC Temperature in Early January 2013",
       x = "Time (Hour)",
       y = "Temperature (°F)",
       color = "Humidity") +
  theme_minimal()

# Show in knitted report
p
```

``` r
# Exporting scatterplot
ggsave("scatterplot_temp_vs_time.png", plot = p, width = 7, height = 4)
```

##### Descriptions of the graph’s pattern

The scatter plot shows a gradual increase in temperature over the next
two weeks starting from January 1st. There was a big temperature
difference in the beginning of January and then it slowly decreased and
increased by mid-January. The humidity also increased comparing to early
January from 40s to approaching 100 toward mid-January.

num_var <- rnorm(10)
log_var <- num_var > 0
char_var <- c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j")
fact_var <- factor(rep(c("low", "medium", "high"), length.out = 10))
df <- data.frame(num_var, log_var, char_var, fact_var)
df

The `pull` function works for taking the average of the numbers and
logical vectors since it’s stored as 1s or 0s. However, it shows an
error message for both character vector and factor vector. Character
vector is not stored as numeric values, so there will be no numbers to
average. Factor vector is internally stored as integers, but `mean()`
doesn’t automatically use it unless explicitly said to.
