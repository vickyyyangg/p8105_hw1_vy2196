### Problem 1
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(moderndive)   # load the package
data("early_january_weather")  # load dataset
head(early_january_weather) #first few rows and columns of data
```

#### Data description
The `early_january_weather` dataset contains `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns. 

It includes hourly weather observations from New York City in early January 2013. 
Key variables include:

- `time_hour`: the date-time of observation  
- `temp`: temperature in Fahrenheit  
- `humid`: relative humidity (0–100)  
- `wind_dir`: wind direction
- `wind_speed`: wind speed in mph  
- `visib`: visibility in miles  
- plus other variables describing conditions such as `pressure`and `origin`.

The mean temperature during this period was 
`r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE), 1)` °F.
